# The models so far

Throughout the course of the summer school, many of the models we have studied so far can be written in the generic form:
\begin{equation*}
\eta_{ij} = \beta_{0j} + \alpha_{i} + \delta_{ij},
\end{equation*}
where:

-   $\beta_{0j}$ are species-specific intercepts (column standardization);
-   $\alpha_i$ are (optional) row effects (row standardization);
-   $\delta_{ij}$ is "stuff" e.g., effects of measured covariates, latent variables, traits and phylogeny etc...

# The models so far

Throughout the course of the summer school, many of the models we have studied so far can be written in the generic form:
\begin{equation*}
\eta_{ij} = \beta_{0j} + \alpha_{i} + \delta_{ij}.
\end{equation*}
For the next little bit, we will assume $\alpha_i$ is always included i.e., both rows and columns are standardized.

By doing so, we can focus on the $\delta_{ij}$ part of the model i.e., what is left over after adjusting for heterogeneity in recorded species prevalence and site sampling effort.

# What to do about $\delta_{ij}$?

On Wednesday, we covered the idea of model-based ordination or some variation thereof, where $\delta_{ij} = \mathbf{u}^\top_i \mathbf{\gamma}_j$. Provided the number of latent variables is small, then the $\mathbf{u}_i$'s and/or $\mathbf{\gamma}_j$'s can be plotted in some way to give a low-dimensional representation of patterns in species composition/indicator species etc...

\pause

In this lecture, we will talk about another way to model the $\delta_{ij}$'s using ideas from clustering.



# What to do about $\delta_{ij}$?

Consider again the model
\begin{equation*}
\eta_{ij} = \beta_{0j} + \alpha_{i} + \delta_{ij},
\end{equation*}
and suppose now the $\delta_{ij}$'s are just directly estimated as fixed effects, alongside the $\beta_{0j}$'s and $\alpha_{i}$. We will refer this as the **saturated** model, since:

-   it estimates a unique "interaction" for every combination of sites and species;
-   the number of parameters is basically the same as the number of observations.


# What to do about $\delta_{ij}$?

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align = "centre"}
library(tidyverse)
library(colorspace)

# Dummy data
set.seed(062025)

x <- paste("spp", LETTERS[1:20])
y <- paste ("site", seq(1,40))
data <- expand.grid(X = x, Y = y)
data$Z <- rnorm(400, 0, 0.5)
data <- data %>% 
    mutate(Y = fct_inorder(Y) %>% fct_rev(),
           X = fct_inorder(X))
 
# Heatmap 
ggplot(data, aes(X, Y, fill= Z)) + 
    geom_tile(show.legend = FALSE) + 
    labs(x = "Species", y = "Site") +

    theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```


# Simplifying the $\delta_{ij}$'s

The above may be overly complex for many multivariate abundance datasets however, as in practice there may be **row patterns**

# Clustering the $\delta_{ij}$'s

The above motivates a way of simplifying the saturated model, namely by clustering the interaction terms $\delta_{ij}$'s based on the row and/or column indices:

- **Row/site clustering**: $\delta_{rj}$ where $r = 1, \ldots,R < n$;
- **Column/species clustering**: $\delta_{ic}$ where $c = 1, \ldots, C < m$;
- **Biclustering**: $\delta_{rc}$.


# Row pattern detection model
Assume the patterns of site relative abundance can be clustered into one of $R < n$ groups:
\begin{equation*}
\eta_{ij} = \beta_{0j} + \alpha_{i} + \delta_{rj}.
\end{equation*}

\textcolor{blue}{Intuition}: The assemblage is comprised of only a small number of ``species profiles". Two sites $i$ and $i'$ in the same species profile have the same relative abundance and only differ in their $\alpha_{i}$'s e.g., site total abundance, sampling effort, and so on.


# Column pattern detection model
Assume the species can be clustered into one of $C < m$ gr
\begin{equation*}
\eta_{ij} = \beta_{0j} + \alpha_{i} + \delta_{ic}.
\end{equation*}

\textcolor{blue}{Intuition}: The species in the assemblage can be classified into a small number of "archetypes" (or guilds?). Two species $j$ and $j'$ in the same guild have the same distribution across sites and only differ in their $\beta_{0j}$'s e.g., overall prevalence. 


# Biclustering pattern detection model
Assume the species can be clustered into one of $C < m$ groups:
\begin{equation*}
\eta_{ij} = \beta_{0j} + \alpha_{i} + \delta_{ic}.
\end{equation*}

\textcolor{blue}{Intuition}: Combine the ideas of species profiles and guilds.

We will talk briefly about the stats behind these models a bit later...


# Pattern detection models
Like model-based unconstrained ordination, clustering/pattern detection offers a parsimonious way of understanding the species community. But their goals are different:

- Is your goal a low-dimensional representation of how species composition varies over sites, or do you want to \textcolor{magenta}{find sites with the same/similar species composition}?
- Is your goal a low-dimensional representation of which species primarily drive composition across sites, or do you want to \textcolor{magenta}{find species with the same/similar distributions}? 

Can read a bit more about the differing characteristics of ordination versus clustering in Section 10.1 of [Legendre and Legendre, 2012](https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/Numerical_Ecology/DKlUIQcHhOsC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=ordination+versus+clustering+ecology&pg=PA523&printsec=frontcover), and Section 3.1 of [McGarigal et al., 2000](https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/Multivariate_Statistics_for_Wildlife_and/mXHrBwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=ordination+versus+clustering+ecology&pg=PA122&printsec=frontcover).


# Pattern detection models
Note environmental covariates and species traits are not utilized in the PD models discussed so far, analogous to model-based unconstrained ordination. We will discuss how to incorporate covariates later.

\pause

What about doing both unconstrained ordination and clustering simultaneously?

You can! We won't talk about it in this lecture, but see [Hui, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2016.07.008) and [Stratton et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14389) for some ideas. 


# Pattern detection models -- A bit of statistics
To fit something like the row pattern detection model with $R < n$,
\begin{equation*}
\eta_{ij} = \beta_{0j} + \alpha_{i} + \delta_{rj},
\end{equation*}
we can assume:

\small 
1. The *prior* probability for site $i$ to belong to cluster $r$ is given by $\pi_r$ (to be estimated);
2. The species are independent of each other, conditional on belong to the same cluster (big assumption!);
3. Species responses $y_{ij}$ come from some distribution with mean given by $\mu_{ij} = g^{-1}(\eta_{ij})$ plus some species-specific dispersion/nuisance parameters as required

\normalsize

Statistically, this results in a [finite mixture model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model).


# Pattern detection models -- A bit of statistics
Statistically, this results in a [finite mixture model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model). 

Things to think about:

- What distribution to assume for $y_{ij}$ e.g., presence-absence, counts, biomass, percent cover etc...
- What to choose for $R$ and/or $C$
- Do you need the row effects $\alpha_{i}$? Depends on the interpretation...

\small

- Can use AICs and BICs to choose the number of row/column clusters. Can also use it to decide what kind of PD model you want, but really that should be governed by the question of interest!
- Model diagnostics are possible like with other models introduced previously;
- Profile plots as a way of visualizing the uncovered cluster profiles i.e., species profiles, archetypes of guilds;
- The more mathematically curious can read [Pledger and Arnold, 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2013.05.013)


# The state of play with \texttt{clustglm}
Unfortunately, [clustglm](https://github.com/vuw-clustering/clustglm) is not actively maintained, and has lots of limitations:

- Handles only a very limited number of response types;
- Standard errors are not done properly;
- Slow;
- Was an attempt, but at the moment does not practically do enough, to replace aspects of distance-based clustering

# Clustering incorporating covariates
There are two (main) ways we can think of involving measured covariates $\mathbf{x}_i$ in the clustering process:

1. Cluster species that have the same/similar responses to environment/habitat factors;
2. Use environment/habitat factors to drive the process of clustering sites with similar species profiles;

\pause

The former leads to species guilds or **species archetype models**, and the latter leads to **model-based bioregionalization**


# Species archetype models
Some starting papers in SAMs include [Dunstan et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2010.11.030), [Dunstan et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13253-013-0146-x), and [Hui et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1890/12-1322.1). 

But intuitively, we want to cluster on the *shape* of the environmental response.

# Species archetype models
Statistically, and removing the optional row effects $\alpha_i$ as the mindset is now more about JSDMs than ordination, SAMs can be written as:
\begin{equation*}
\eta_{ij} = \beta_{0j} + \mathbf{x}_i^\top \mathbf{\beta}_c + \text{stuff}...,
\end{equation*}

where species are clustered into $C < m$ archetypes, and the intercepts are specific to each species. We also assume the *prior* probability for species $j$ to belong to archetype $c$ is given by $\pi_c$ (to be estimated). Note the link to column pattern detection models!

\pause 

SAMs are again a type of [finite mixture model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model), so you can also retrieve a *posterior probability* of a species belonging to an archetype.


# Species archetype models
Software-wise, [ecomix](https://github.com/skiptoniam/ecomix) can fit these models but is slow and has limitations. [assam](https://github.com/fhui28/assam), by yours truly, is WIP that is more approximate but computationally more scalable and flexible.

Things to think about:

- What distribution to assume for $y_{ij}$ e.g., presence-absence, counts, biomass, percent cover etc...
- How many archetypes?
- What to include in \text{stuff}?



# Model-based bioregionalization
Some starting papers in SAMs include [Foster et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1002/env.2245), [Hill et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13447), and [Woolley et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biz133). 

But intuitively, sites with *similar environments/habitats should have similar species profiles*, even if they are far apart in space.

# Model-based bioregionalization
Statistically, and removing the optional row effects $\alpha_i$ as the mindset is now more about JSDMs than ordination, such bioregion models can be written as:
\begin{equation*}
\eta_{ij} = \beta_{0j} + \eta_{rj} + \text{stuff}; \quad \text{P}(\text{site} \; i \; \text{belongs to bioregion} \; r) = \pi_r(\mathbf{x}_i, \text{stuff2}),
\end{equation*}
where sites are clustered into $R < n$ bioregions. The *prior* probabilities $\pi_r(\mathbf{x}_i)$ can now vary with the measured covariates, and the parameters in this probability function are estimated. Note the similarity to row pattern detection models! 

\pause 

Bioregion models are a type of [finite mixture of experts model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_of_experts), so you can also retrieve a *posterior probability* of a site belonging to a bioregion.


# Model-based bioregionalization
Software-wise, [ecomix](https://github.com/skiptoniam/ecomix) can fit these models but is slow and has limitations. Otherwise, there exists some bespoke code here and there but research is needed here!

Things to think about:

- What distribution to assume for $y_{ij}$ e.g., presence-absence, counts, biomass, percent cover etc...
- How many bioregions?
- What to include in \text{stuff} and \text{stuff2}?


# Outgoing remarks
- Model-based clustering ecology is much *less* developed than model-based ordination, both in terms of methods and software;
- Why do ecologists want to cluster?
- Model-based hierarchical clustering is a big gap!
- Conversely, models open up interesting new flavors of clustering e.g., [Bystrova et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2021.601384); [Hui et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomtc/ujad001).
